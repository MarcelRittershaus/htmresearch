  An object machine is a helper class that allows the user to quickly create
  objects and sensations for inference experiments. It is designed to send
  SDR's in a canonical format to such experiments. It should be subclassed
  for various ways of defining and creating objects (discrete (location,
  feature) pairs, continuous location SDR's, etc.).

  This is the base class. It has a few generic methods and specifies
  required methods for any child class.
